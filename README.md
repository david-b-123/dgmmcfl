# Deep Gaussian Mixture Models with Common Factor Loadings

A model-based method enabling dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, and visualisation.

This is a culmination of my Thesis project for the Master in Science (Statistics), supervised by Professor Geoffrey McLachlan.

Note, the thesis attached is a preliminary copy. Updates will be made as time progresses.

It is based on the following work, so please reference the following:
