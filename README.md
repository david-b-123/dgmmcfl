# Deep Gaussian Mixture Models with Common Factor Loadings

A model-based method capable of unifying dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, and visualisation.

This is a culmination of my Thesis project for the Master in Science (Statistics), supervised by Professor Geoffrey McLachlan.

My Thesis is also attached here.



It is based on the following work, so please reference the following:
